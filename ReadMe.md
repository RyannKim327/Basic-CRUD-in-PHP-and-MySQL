### Create
<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">You may found it in the index.php, where the INSERT query is there around line 127 to line 132 of the index.php</blockquote>

### Read
<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">Basically, you may found this in the most of the file, but I created one file, where you can easily see the Read, and it is in the lists.php. I use read alsi for knowling if the user is exixted in the index.php, also auto complete in the update.php.</blockquote>

### Update
<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">You may see this in the update.php. And I hope the code explains a lot.</blockquote>

### Delete
<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">Delete can be found in the lists.php. Around line 39 to 49. This is to lessen the file, also to make a one file coding inside of it.</blockquote>
